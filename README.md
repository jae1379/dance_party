# Dace Party Overlay!

# Requriements (to put your picture in replacement of my dogs):
1. Adobe After Effects
2. Script editor (I use Atom editor)
3. +/- Photoshop

# Directions:
1. Download the folder
2. Open After effects
3. Replace the my dogs picture PNG to your picture (preferably nicely edited and clean edges that matches my dogs png size)
4. Play the timeline and see if everything lines up--if not, then readjust the picture to align the head frame by frame
5. Once everything is done, export! (I do it on H.264 Youtube 1080p Preset; you don't need to include alpha channel)
6. Once the video file done exporting, open up Atom editor and edit index.html & script.js under js folder
 6.1 index.html = chnange "FINAL_MP4_FILE_NAME" to your file name (Has to be exactly the same)
 6.2 script.js = change  "YOURCHANNELID" to your channel name (ie jae1379), and change "46e3bf7a-567a-4d1a-8d3d-bf088b14703d" to your custom reward ID as found with instafluff's amazing reward ID finder (& go support him!) https://github.com/instafluff/TwitchCustomRewardID; SAVE!
7. Add browser soure --> local file --> index.html
8. Add chroma key filter to green and adjust so that it's chroma-keying just right (too much will be no show, too little will not work). 
9. Done! Any questions? Come hang out twitch.tv/jae1379 :D

 # Future fix:
 Would like to not use mp4 file with but use webm file with alpha channel
